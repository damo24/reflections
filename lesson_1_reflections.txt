What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: It is possible to save a stable version of the software instead of a non tested one
	Cons: If the computer hangs or lose power supply the work already done will be losed

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it is common to have features that span multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    The git log command is used to view the commit history, this command shows the commit ID and the descripcion entered by the commiter.
	The git diff command is used to commpare the changes line to line of the files commited in 2 commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
